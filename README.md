Planned Features: game board constantly shuffles; User is a able to target/shoot at any cell on the game board.

Bugs/Features: Currently working on a check function that will randomly arrange the game board each time the user plays. Currently have a shuffle function that shuffles the 2d array indices vertically.
Another Bug/feature is that the status variable isn't posting to the h2 tags.
Please feel free to contribute to either issue.

Wishlist features: AI Game Board; a set function that allows a player to pick and choose where their ships are placed; also some audio files would be great.

Shout outs: Ilias and Annabelle Thanks so much for all the help.
